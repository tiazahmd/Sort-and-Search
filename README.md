### Sort-and-Search
C programs with various sort and search algorithm

**Version 1**: Only has Bubble sort algorithm at the moment. Uses pre-included data set.

**Version 2**: Does not have pre-included data set. Now takes input from user.

**Version 3**: Intruducing Linear search. Takes input from user and then asks which integer to look for. Then tells the user if the integer is on the list or not..

**Version 4**: Introducing character (as opposed to integer only) support. Bubble sort and linear search. Takes input from user. Character support: Only takes in single digits (0 - 9) at the moment.

**Version 5**: Introducing binary search (faster than linear search). Sorting: Bubble sort. Takes input from user. Character support: Now takes multiple *digits* (example: 12 or 99 or 121) or *characters* (example: BBAS or ASSI) - both for sorting and searching purposes.
